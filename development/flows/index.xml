      <description>In Flogo, the concept of an application-level property bag is made available to flow developers that want to reuse properties across different flows, within the same application for trigger settings or as input to activities. Properties are exposed via the $property resolver and made available to the scopes defined in the mappings documentation.
Flow configuration Properties are defined within the root of the application json, as shown below via the properties element.</description>

      <description>For Flogo a Flow is more inline with the concept of a function, that is, a Flow has both input and output parameters. The concept of decoupling a trigger from a flow is a key part of supporting multiple triggers and re-use/sharing of a flow. A Flow can now operate against the data that it has defined within its declartion, in otherwords, just like a function, the scope of data that a Flow can operate against must reside within either the Flow context (or as an environment variable).</description>

      <description>What is an iterator in Flogo? The iterator construct in Flogo enables the iteration of a single activity. The configuration elements are associated with that activity. In Flogo, you can iterate only over a single activity. The iterator acts much like a foreach loop in any procedural language. If you need to iterate over multiple activity calls, simply place an iterator on a subflow.
Flow configuration Iterators are associated with an activity.</description>

      <description>What are mappings? A mapping in Flogo can be used to assign the value of a parameter (flow input, for example) to that of an input parameters of an activity or to the value of another flow scoped variable.
Types of mappings Flogo infers the mapping type based on the structure of the mapping itself. The following list details the specifics around each mapping type.
   Type Description Format     literal A literal mapping.</description>
