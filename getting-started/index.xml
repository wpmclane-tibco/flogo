      <description>Before you get started Before you can get started with the cli tools you need to make sure you have the Go programming language installed.
Flogo makes use of Go Modules, as such, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to ensure that you have at least Go 1.11.
 Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to set your GOPATH variable and make sure that $GOPATH/bin is part of your path. (see here or here for more details)</description>
